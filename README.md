## Quick Start

1. Download the latest release zip from the [Releases page](../../releases/latest) to a folder **outside** your project directory (e.g., `~/Downloads`).
2. Extract the zip. It contains an `aidlc-rules/` folder with two subdirectories:
   - `aws-aidlc-rules/` — the core AI-DLC workflow rules
   - `aws-aidlc-rule-details/` — supporting documents referenced by the rules
3. Copy both folders into your project, following the setup for your platform below.

> **Note**: The extracted folder may contain a top-level directory (e.g., `aidlc-workflows-0.1.0/`). Navigate into it first so that `aidlc-rules/` is directly accessible.

### Kiro

AI-DLC uses [Kiro Steering Files](https://kiro.dev/docs/cli/steering/) within your project workspace. Copy the rules into your project's `.kiro` folder:

1. Create the directories `.kiro/steering` and `.kiro/aws-aidlc-rule-details` in your project root.
2. Copy `aws-aidlc-rules/` into `.kiro/steering/`.
3. Copy `aws-aidlc-rule-details/` into `.kiro/`.

The commands below assume you extracted the zip to your `Downloads` folder. If you used a different location, replace `Downloads` with your actual folder path.

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
mkdir -p .kiro/steering
cp -R ~/Downloads/aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rules .kiro/steering/
cp -R ~/Downloads/aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rule-details .kiro/
```

On Windows (CMD):
```cmd
mkdir .kiro\steering
xcopy %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\aidlc-rules\aws-aidlc-rules .kiro\steering\aws-aidlc-rules\ /E /I
xcopy %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\aidlc-rules\aws-aidlc-rule-details .kiro\aws-aidlc-rule-details\ /E /I
```

Your project should look like:
```
<project-root>/
    ├── .kiro/
    │     ├── steering/
    │     │      ├── aws-aidlc-rules/
    │     ├── aws-aidlc-rule-details/
```

To verify the rules are loaded:

#### Kiro IDE 

Open the steering files panel and confirm you see an entry for `core-workflow` under `Workspace` as shown in the screenshot below.

<img src="./assets/images/kiro-ide-aidlc-rules-loaded.png?raw=true" alt="AI-DLC Rules in Kiro IDE" width="700" height="450">

We use Kiro IDE in Vibe mode to run the AI-DLC workflow. This ensures that AI-DLC workflow guides the development workflow in Kiro. At times, Kiro may nudge you to switch to spec mode. Select `No` to such prompts to stay in Vibe mode.

<img src="./assets/images/kiro-sdd-nudge.png" alt="Staying in Kiro Vibe mode" width="500" height="175">

#### Kiro CLI
Run `kiro-cli`, then `/context show`, and confirm entries for `.kiro/steering/aws-aidlc-rules`.

### Amazon Q Developer IDE Plugin/Extension

AI-DLC uses [Amazon Q Rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazonq/latest/qdeveloper-ug/context-project-rules.html) within your project workspace. Copy the rules into your project's `.amazonq` folder:

1. Create the directories `.amazonq/rules` and `.amazonq/aws-aidlc-rule-details` in your project root.
2. Copy `aws-aidlc-rules/` into `.amazonq/rules/`.
3. Copy `aws-aidlc-rule-details/` into `.amazonq/`.

The commands below assume you extracted the zip to your `Downloads` folder. If you used a different location, replace `Downloads` with your actual folder path.

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
mkdir -p .amazonq/rules
cp -R ~/Downloads/aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rules .amazonq/rules/
cp -R ~/Downloads/aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rule-details .amazonq/
```

On Windows (CMD):
```cmd
mkdir .amazonq\rules
xcopy %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\aidlc-rules\aws-aidlc-rules .amazonq\rules\aws-aidlc-rules\ /E /I
xcopy %USERPROFILE%\Downloads\aidlc-rules\aws-aidlc-rule-details .amazonq\aws-aidlc-rule-details\ /E /I
```

Your project should look like:
```
<project-root>/
    ├── .amazonq/
    │     ├── rules/
    │     │     ├── aws-aidlc-rules/
    │     ├── aws-aidlc-rule-details/
```

To verify the rules are loaded:

1. In the Amazon Q Chat window, click the `Rules` button in the lower right corner.
2. Confirm you see entries for `.amazonq/rules/aws-aidlc-rules`.

---

### GitHub Copilot

AI-DLC uses [GitHub Copilot custom instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/customization/custom-instructions) to implement its intelligent workflow. The `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file is automatically detected and applied to all chat requests in the workspace.

The commands below assume you extracted the zip to your `Downloads` folder. If you used a different location, replace `Downloads` with your actual folder path.

**Unix/Linux/macOS:**
```bash
mkdir -p .github
cp ~/Downloads/aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rules/core-workflow.md .github/copilot-instructions.md
mkdir -p .aidlc-rule-details
cp -R ~/Downloads/aidlc-rules/aws-aidlc-rule-details/* .aidlc-rule-details/
```

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path ".github"
Copy-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\aidlc-rules\aws-aidlc-rules\core-workflow.md" ".github\copilot-instructions.md"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force -Path ".aidlc-rule-details"
Copy-Item "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\aidlc-rules\aws-aidlc-rule-details\*" ".aidlc-rule-details\" -Recurse
```

**Windows CMD:**
```cmd
mkdir .github
copy "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\aidlc-rules\aws-aidlc-rules\core-workflow.md" ".github\copilot-instructions.md"
mkdir .aidlc-rule-details
xcopy "%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\aidlc-rules\aws-aidlc-rule-details" ".aidlc-rule-details\" /E /I
```

**Verify Setup:**
1. Open VS Code with your project folder
2. Open the Copilot Chat panel (Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+I)
3. Select **Configure Chat** (gear icon) > **Chat Instructions** and verify that `copilot-instructions` is listed
4. Alternatively, type `/instructions` in the chat input to view active instructions

**Directory Structure:**
```
<my-project>/
├── .github/
│   └── copilot-instructions.md
└── .aidlc-rule-details/
    ├── common/
    ├── inception/
    ├── construction/
    └── operations/
```

### Other Agents

AI-DLC works with any coding agent that supports project-level rules or steering files. The general approach:

1. Place `aws-aidlc-rules/` wherever your agent reads project rules from (consult your agent's documentation).
2. Place `aws-aidlc-rule-details/` at a sibling level so the rules can reference it.

If your agent has no convention for rules files, place both folders at your project root and point the agent to `aws-aidlc-rules/` as its rules directory.

---

## Usage

1. Start any software development project by stating your intent starting with the phrase **"Using AI-DLC, ..."** in the chat
2. AI-DLC workflow automatically activates and guides you from there
3. Answer structured questions that AI-DLC asks you
4. Carefully review every plan that AI generates. Provide your oversight and validation
5. Review the execution plan to see which stages will run
6. Carefully review the artifacts and approve each stage to maintain control
7. All the artifacts will be generated in the `aidlc-docs/` directory

---

## Three-Phase Adaptive Workflow

AI-DLC follows a structured three-phase approach that adapts to your project's complexity:

### 🔵 INCEPTION PHASE
Determines **WHAT** to build and **WHY**
- Requirements analysis and validation
- User story creation (when applicable)
- Application Design and creating units of work for parallel development
- Risk assessment and complexity evaluation

### 🟢 CONSTRUCTION PHASE
Determines **HOW** to build it
- Detailed component design
- Code generation and implementation
- Build configuration and testing strategies
- Quality assurance and validation

### 🟡 OPERATIONS PHASE
Deployment and monitoring (future)
- Deployment automation and infrastructure
- Monitoring and observability setup
- Production readiness validation

---

## Key Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Adaptive Intelligence** | Only executes stages that add value to your specific request |
| **Context-Aware** | Analyzes existing codebase and complexity requirements |
| **Risk-Based** | Complex changes get comprehensive treatment, simple changes stay efficient |
| **Question-Driven** | Structured multiple-choice questions in files, not chat |
| **Always in Control** | Review execution plans and approve each phase |

---

## Tenets

These are our core principles to guide our decision making.

- **No duplication**. The source of truth lives in one place. If we add support for new tools or formats that require specific files, we generate them from the source rather than maintaining separate copies.

- **Methodology first**. AI-DLC is fundamentally a methodology, not a tool. Users shouldn't need to install anything to get started. That said, we're open to convenience tooling (scripts, CLIs) down the road if it helps users adopt or extend the methodology.

- **Reproducible**. Rules should be clear enough that different models produce similar outcomes. We know models behave differently, but the methodology should minimize variance through explicit guidance.

- **Agnostic**. The methodology works with any IDE, agent, or model. We don't tie ourselves to specific tools or vendors.

- **Human in the loop**. Critical decisions require explicit user confirmation. The agent proposes, the human approves.

## Troubleshooting

### General Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Rules not loading | Check file exists in the correct location for your platform |
| File encoding issues | Ensure files are UTF-8 encoded |
| Rules not applied in session | Start a new chat session after file changes |
| Rule details not loading | Verify `.aidlc-rule-details/` exists with subdirectories |

### Platform-Specific Issues

#### Amazon Q Developer / Kiro
- Use `/context show` to verify rules are loaded
- Check `.amazonq/rules/` or `.kiro/steering/` directory structure

#### Cursor
- For "Apply Intelligently", ensure a description is defined in frontmatter
- Check **Cursor Settings → Rules** to ensure the rule is enabled
- If rule is too large (>500 lines), split into multiple focused rules

#### Cline
- Check the Rules popover under the chat input field
- Toggle rule files on/off as needed using the popover UI

#### Claude Code
- Use `/config` command to view current configuration
- Ask "What instructions are currently active in this project?"

#### GitHub Copilot
- Select **Configure Chat** (gear icon) > **Chat Instructions** to verify instructions are loaded
- Type `/instructions` in the chat input to view active instruction files
- Check that `.github/copilot-instructions.md` exists in your workspace root

### File Path Issues on Windows
- Use forward slashes `/` in file paths within markdown files
- Windows paths with backslashes may not work correctly
