# Application Design - Detailed Steps

## Purpose
**High-level component identification and service layer design**

Application Design focuses on:
- Identifying main functional components and their responsibilities
- Defining component interfaces (not detailed business logic)
- Designing service layer for orchestration
- Establishing component dependencies and communication patterns

**Note**: Detailed business logic design happens later in Functional Design (per-unit, CONSTRUCTION phase)

## Prerequisites
- Context Assessment must be complete
- Requirements Assessment recommended (provides functional context)
- Story Development recommended (user stories guide design decisions)
- Execution plan must indicate Application Design stage should execute

## Step-by-Step Execution

### 1. Analyze Context
- Read `aidlc-docs/inception/requirements/requirements.md` and `aidlc-docs/inception/user-stories/stories.md`
- Identify key business capabilities and functional areas
- Determine design scope and complexity

### 2. Create Application Design Plan
- Generate plan with checkboxes [] for application design
- Focus on components, responsibilities, methods, business rules, and services
- Each step and sub-step should have a checkbox []

### 3. Include Mandatory Design Artifacts in Plan
- **ALWAYS** include these mandatory artifacts in the design plan:
  - [ ] Generate components.md with component definitions and high-level responsibilities
  - [ ] Generate component-methods.md with method signatures (business rules detailed later in Functional Design)
  - [ ] Generate services.md with service definitions and orchestration patterns
  - [ ] Generate component-dependency.md with dependency relationships and communication patterns
  - [ ] Validate design completeness and consistency

### 4. Generate Context-Appropriate Questions
Generate questions relevant to this specific application design.

- EMBED questions using [Answer]: tag format
- Focus on ambiguities and missing information
- Ask about component identification, methods, service layer, dependencies, and patterns as needed

### 5. Store Application Design Plan
- Save as `aidlc-docs/inception/plans/application-design-plan.md`
- Include all [Answer]: tags for user input
- Ensure plan covers all design aspects

### 6. Request User Input
- Ask user to fill [Answer]: tags directly in the plan document
- Emphasize importance of design decisions
- Provide clear instructions on completing the [Answer]: tags

### 7. Collect Answers
- Wait for user to provide answers to all questions using [Answer]: tags in the document
- Do not proceed until ALL [Answer]: tags are completed
- Review the document to ensure no [Answer]: tags are left blank

### 8. Analyze Answers
Review all user answers for clarity and completeness.

### 9. Follow-up Questions
If ambiguous answers are detected, add clarification questions to the plan document. Do not proceed until resolved.

### 10. Generate Application Design Artifacts
- Execute the approved plan to generate design artifacts
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/components.md` with:
  - Component name and purpose
  - Component responsibilities
  - Component interfaces
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/component-methods.md` with:
  - Method signatures for each component
  - High-level purpose of each method
  - Input/output types
  - Note: Detailed business rules will be defined in Functional Design (per-unit, CONSTRUCTION phase)
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/services.md` with:
  - Service definitions
  - Service responsibilities
  - Service interactions and orchestration
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/component-dependency.md` with:
  - Dependency matrix showing relationships
  - Communication patterns between components
  - Data flow diagrams
- Create `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/application-design.md` that consolidates the multiple design docs created above in a single doc.

### 11. Log Approval
- Log approval prompt with timestamp in `aidlc-docs/audit.md`
- Include complete approval prompt text
- Use ISO 8601 timestamp format

### 12. Present Completion Message
Present completion message: "Application Design complete. Please review `aidlc-docs/inception/application-design/`. You may request changes or approve to continue to [Units Generation/CONSTRUCTION PHASE]."
If Units Generation is skipped, mention: "You may also choose to add Units Generation stage (currently skipped)."

### 13. Wait for Explicit Approval
- Do not proceed until the user explicitly approves the application design
- Approval must be clear and unambiguous
- If user requests changes, update the design and repeat the approval process

### 14. Record Approval Response
- Log the user's approval response with timestamp in `aidlc-docs/audit.md`
- Include the exact user response text
- Mark the approval status clearly

### 15. Update Progress
- Mark Application Design stage complete in `aidlc-docs/aidlc-state.md`
- Update the "Current Status" section
- Prepare for transition to next stage
