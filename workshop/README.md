# AI-DLC Workshop Materials

This directory contains comprehensive workshop materials for learning and applying the AI-DLC (AI-Driven Development Life Cycle) workflow.

## Workshop Overview

The AI-DLC workshops provide hands-on experience with the complete AI-DLC workflow, from discovery through testing. Choose the workshop format that best fits your needs:

- **2-Day Workshop**: Condensed introduction for teams new to AI-DLC
- **5-Day Workshop**: Comprehensive, in-depth coverage for production adoption

## Workshop Structure

### Core Materials

1. **Installation Guide** (`00-installation-guide.md`)
   - Step-by-step setup instructions
   - Platform-specific configuration
   - Verification steps

2. **Workshop Guides**
   - **2-Day Workshop** (`01-workshop-2day.md`)
   - **5-Day Workshop** (`02-workshop-5day.md`)

3. **Phase Instructions** (`phase-instructions/`)
   - Detailed instructions for each phase
   - Example inputs for phase transitions
   - Tips and best practices

4. **Report Templates** (`report-templates/`)
   - Discovery Report
   - Business Vision Report
   - Scope Report
   - Design Compatibility Report

## Workshop Phases

The workshops cover six main phases:

1. **Discovery**: Establish environment, coding standards, Agile process
2. **Vision**: Business vision and MVP scope
3. **Units and User Stories**: Problem breakdown and story creation
4. **Design**: Complete design review
5. **Code Development**: AI builds the code
6. **Testing**: Test plan, harness, and execution

## Getting Started

### Step 1: Choose Your Workshop

- **New to AI-DLC?** Start with the 2-Day Workshop
- **Ready for Production?** Use the 5-Day Workshop

### Step 2: Complete Installation

Follow the installation guide (`00-installation-guide.md`) to set up AI-DLC in your environment.

### Step 3: Review Workshop Guide

Read the appropriate workshop guide:
- `01-workshop-2day.md` for 2-day workshop
- `02-workshop-5day.md` for 5-day workshop

### Step 4: Follow Phase Instructions

Use the phase instructions in `phase-instructions/` to guide each phase:
- `01-discovery.md`
- `02-vision.md`
- `03-units-and-stories.md`
- `04-design.md`
- `05-code-development.md`
- `06-testing.md`

### Step 5: Generate Reports

Use the report templates in `report-templates/` to document each phase:
- `discovery-report.md`
- `business-vision-report.md`
- `scope-report.md`
- `design-compatibility-report.md`

## Phase Transitions

When transitioning between phases, use the example phase boundary inputs provided in each phase instruction file. These inputs clearly communicate phase completion and readiness to proceed.

**Example:**
```
Discovery phase complete. Environment established, coding standards defined, Agile process documented. Ready to proceed to Vision phase.
```

## Workshop Deliverables

By the end of the workshop, you will have:

- Complete project documentation
- Generated code and tests
- Comprehensive reports for each phase
- Understanding of AI-DLC workflow
- Experience applying AI-DLC to a project

## Key Features

### Example Inputs

Each phase instruction file includes example inputs that can be used to:
- Start each phase
- Transition between phases
- Provide boundaries and context
- Communicate completion

### Report Templates

Comprehensive report templates ensure:
- Consistent documentation
- Complete phase coverage
- Clear human tasks
- Stakeholder alignment

### Time Management

Both workshops include:
- Detailed schedules
- Time allocations
- Break recommendations
- Time management tips

## Best Practices

1. **Follow the Workflow**: Don't skip phases - each builds on the previous
2. **Use Example Inputs**: Leverage provided examples for phase transitions
3. **Generate Reports**: Complete all reports for each phase
4. **Review Thoroughly**: Review deliverables before proceeding
5. **Document Decisions**: Capture all decisions in reports and audit trail

## Common Questions

**Q: Can I customize the workshop?**
A: Yes, adapt the workshops to your team's needs and timeline.

**Q: What if we don't finish a phase?**
A: Document progress and continue in the next session. Use phase boundary inputs to resume.

**Q: Can we use our own project?**
A: Yes, the workshops work with any project. Choose a project appropriate for the workshop duration.

**Q: What if we have questions?**
A: Refer to the phase instructions, report templates, and main AI-DLC documentation.
