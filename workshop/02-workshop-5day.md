## Time Management Tips

1. **Detailed Planning**: Use Day 1 to thoroughly plan the project scope
2. **Iterative Refinement**: Allow time for refinement in each phase
3. **Quality Focus**: Don't rush - focus on quality deliverables
4. **Documentation**: Document decisions and rationale throughout
5. **Review Points**: Use scheduled review points to catch issues early

---

## Common Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Scope Creep
**Solution**: Use Vision phase to clearly define MVP scope. Use [Scope Report](report-templates/scope-report.md) to validate boundaries.

### Challenge: Design Conflicts
**Solution**: Use [Design Compatibility Report](report-templates/design-compatibility-report.md) to identify conflicts early. Resolve before coding.

### Challenge: Integration Issues
**Solution**: Complete integration on Day 3. Test integration points early on Day 4.

### Challenge: Test Failures
**Solution**: Fix issues incrementally. Don't proceed until tests pass.

### Challenge: Time Overruns
**Solution**: Use phase boundary inputs to move forward. Document what needs refinement later.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Start with Clear Vision**: Spend adequate time on Vision phase
2. **Validate Scope**: Use [Scope Report](report-templates/scope-report.md) to ensure alignment
3. **Design First**: Complete all design work before coding
4. **Test Continuously**: Don't wait until end to test
5. **Document Everything**: Use AI-DLC audit trail
6. **Review Regularly**: Schedule review points
7. **Iterate**: Refine based on learnings

---

## Next Steps After Workshop

1. **Apply to Production**: Use AI-DLC on your next production project
2. **Customize Workflow**: Adapt phases to your team's specific needs
3. **Share Learnings**: Document and share what worked
4. **Build Templates**: Create project-specific templates
5. **Train Team**: Share knowledge with broader team
6. **Iterate and Improve**: Continuously refine your AI-DLC usage
